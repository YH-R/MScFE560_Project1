This will affect the price that market participants are willing to trade the portfolio for. For example, if the price of AAPL goes down due to weak demand for iPhone, and if the price of NFLX rises due to increased popularity of any new popular web series or movie like Squid games, or with increased popularity for META stocks then Portfolio A will be worth less in the eyes of investors. This is a scenario of market risk. Another risk is of earning nothing significant, although both the companies are blue chips but are constantly involved hi-tech research, there is a good chance that these companies would want to use their revenue in developing new technologies by cutting out dividends to shareholders. This way, one may not even get dividends from these stocks and let say the opposite happens for NFLX and META, i.e. they decide to give dividends to their shareholders for showing faith to them, then we may have to pay much more than before to acquire same quantity of NFLX and META stocks to relevel our obligation of short selling."

We see that there is positiv correlation between any two of them. This is very easy to see why they are positively correlated as all of them are marquee players in technology world. We are achieving diversification here by betting on AAPL and betting against META and NFLX. These three companies deal or are specialised in 3 different sectors and thus provide us with diversification."

Thus in terms of risk, out portfolio will do seemingly better than others if the current trends continue. Our portfolio has the best/least coefficient of variation among all portflios that can be created using 3 of the FAANG stocks with atleast one of them in long positions, thus it expected to be the best portflio mathematically."
