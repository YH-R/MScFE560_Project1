Although the companies involved (AAPL, META, NFLX) are part of the \"FAANG\", their prices can still change due to their performance and the public's perception of them. This will affect the price that market participants are willing to trade the portfolio for. For example, the price of AAPL might go down due to weak demand for iPhone, or the price of META might rise due to increased popularity of Instagram."
